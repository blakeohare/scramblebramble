# スクランブルブランブル (Scramble Bramble)

This is an entry for Global Game Jam 2023 with the theme of "Roots".

This is a solo entry by Blake O'Hare (user ID: blakeohare)

In this game, weed seeds drop from the sky and land on a hexagonal grid.
If they sit for too long, they start to spread roots. You can click/tap
the cell to clean up. However, if it starts spreading roots, it may take
multiple taps to clean it up.

- The game speeds up as time goes on.
- Score is the number of plants cleaned up.
- The game ends when the entire lawn is filled with weeds.

Survive as long as you can.
